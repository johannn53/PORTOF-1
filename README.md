# PORTOF-1

Hi! I'm Johand and i was an ex marketing with almost 5 years experience. But i have 0 knowledge of any IT industry. So i quit my comfort zone to challenge myself learn to code. Recently i just graduated from a bootcamp with excellent point.

Here is my personal portofolio project. It's far from perfect but i'm proud of it. hopefully some of this can impress you and offer me a job.

I'm familiar with CI/CD, AWS, and heroku(not expert, i have to learn again), but i choose not to use it in this project because last time i got a bills with total charges USD $50++ in less than a month while i have no income.
