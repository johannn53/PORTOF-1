# PORTOF-1

Hi! I'm Johand and i was an ex marketing with almost 5 years experience. But i have 0 knowledge of any IT industry. So i quit my comfort zone to challenge myself learn to code. Recently i just graduated from a bootcamp with excellent point.

Here is my personal portofolio project. It's far from perfect but i'm proud of it. hopefully some of this can impress you and offer me a job.

I'm familiar with CI/CD, AWS, and heroku(not expert, i have to learn again), but i choose not to use it in this project because last time i got a bills with total charges USD $50++ while i have no income. But once i got a job i will sure use it so i can keep practicing to make this project awesome!!

The component in this project is:

1. JavaScript
2. nodeJS
3. expressJS
4. Sequelize (postgreSQL)
5. MCR design pattern
6. RESTful API
7. Auth with jwt token, encrypted password with bcrypt
8. Upload image, jpg, pdf with multer - cloudinary
9. Verification using email when user register an account
10. Unit test using jest (for some method)
11. Documentation API using swagger (soon, for now using postman)
12. HTML / EJS
13. CSS
14. Forgot password using nodemailer, new password will be made using random string
